I have an idea that I would like to implement as a Data Science/Analysis project.


Figure Skating is a sport that combines art, performance and athletics into a beautiful harmony.
Given that performance art are judged rather subjectively, there tend to be cases where the judges of this 
sport are skewed to some participants more than others. This then could potentially lead to unethical favouring and bad judging.


Disclaimer: Neither me nor this project aims to point fingers at anyone, whether they are judges, participants or otherwise.
This is just a fun project that I want to explore to develop my skills as a Data Scientist and thought it would make an interesting
case-study. 


This is a work in progress project. Basically, I have an idea to calculate biases in skating scores. I'll keep updating this regularly. As of now, it exists as a highly abstract concept in my head.

Thank you.
